    "\n",
    "In this course, we treat topics from two perspectives: algorithm perspective and user perspective. Here is how you learn from both these perspectives in Part 1: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we learn about image and video processing in two ways:\n",
    "1. **Algorithm perspective:** Here, you learn by implementation. You look at code and you implement extractors for features or generators for descriptors, in part or in full. \n",
    "2. **User perspective:** Here, you learn by observation and experimentation. You look at images, and think about what you “see”, not as a computer scientist, but as a user of a multimedia system. Different features are able to capture different aspects of what people see when they look at and compare images. \n",

    "These two perspectives will become clearer next week, as we look at image retrieval systems.\n",

The recommender system is a “pairing algorithm”, which will pair people in the course based on their self-reported ice cream eating behavior. For this task, we will use an Ice Cream Consumption data set that we create ourselves. \n",

    "2. **User perspective:** Here, you learn by exercising your creativity. First, think about what the consumption counts in the Ice Cream Consumption data set might actually reflect about the individual users. Then, think about how to make a connection between two users based on what you assume/believe that the counts reflect. The connection that you make should be intended to lead to a happy collaborative relationship between the two people. \n",

    "Looking ahead to what is to come: When you make an actual matching algorithm, you might want to consider what measure you want to optimize. For example, do you want to make it so that there is no pairing for which every participant is equally satisfied or better off (Pareto optimal), or do you want to optimize such that the worst pairing is still as good as possible (Egalitarian). Maybe you want neither of those but include some other neat feature?\n",
