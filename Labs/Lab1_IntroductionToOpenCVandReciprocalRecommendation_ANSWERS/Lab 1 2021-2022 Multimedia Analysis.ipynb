    "\n",
    "### Part 1: OpenCV\n",
    "Your overall mission for Part 1 today is to become familiar with OpenCV, a computer vision library that we will use in this course for image processing and video processing. You will revisit familiar territory: image convolution and the Sobel filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we treat topics from two perspectives: algorithm perspective and user perspective. Here is how you learn from both these perspectives in Part 1: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we learn about image and video processing in two ways:\n",
    "1. **Algorithm perspective:** Here, you learn by implementation. You look at code and you implement extractors for features or generators for descriptors, in part or in full. \n",
    "2. **User perspective:** Here, you learn by observation and experimentation. You look at images, and think about what you “see”, not as a computer scientist, but as a user of a multimedia system. Different features are able to capture different aspects of what people see when they look at and compare images. \n",
    "\n",
    "These two perspectives will become clearer next week, as we look at image retrieval systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Reciprocal Recommendation\n",
    "Your overall mission for Part 2 is to build a simple recommender system. The recommender system is a “pairing algorithm”, which will pair people in the course based on their self-reported ice cream eating behavior. For this task, we will use an Ice Cream Consumption data set that we create ourselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here in Part 2, we also have learn two perspectives:\n",
    "1. **Algorithm perspective:** Here, you learn by implementation. You become familiar with the distance measures and metrics that we learned about in class, and you also have a chance to experiment with normalization.\n",
    "2. **User perspective:** Here, you learn by exercising your creativity. First, think about what the consumption counts in the Ice Cream Consumption data set might actually reflect about the individual users. Then, think about how to make a connection between two users based on what you assume/believe that the counts reflect. The connection that you make should be intended to lead to a happy collaborative relationship between the two people. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the “pairing algorithms” that you create in order to assign lab partners in the labs starting next week. \n"
